# Dual Contouring Unity Project

A Unity implementation of various **Dual Contouring** algorithms for mesh generation from implicit surfaces. This project includes multiple dual contouring variants with both CPU and GPU implementations.

## Overview

Dual Contouring is a technique for generating meshes from volumetric data represented by implicit functions. Unlike Marching Cubes, Dual Contouring preserves sharp features and produces better-quality meshes by solving a Quadratic Error Function (QEF) to find optimal vertex positions.

This Unity project implements three main variants of the dual contouring algorithm:

- **Uniform Dual Contouring** - Regular grid-based implementation
- **Adaptive Dual Contouring** - Octree-based implementation with level-of-detail support
- **Manifold Dual Contouring** - Specialized version that ensures manifold mesh topology

## Requirements

- **Unity 2022.3.40f1** or later
- **Unity Mathematics Package** (1.2.6)
- Compute Shader support for GPU implementations
